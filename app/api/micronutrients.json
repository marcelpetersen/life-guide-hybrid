        "description": "<p>Vitamin A is a group of unsaturated organic compounds. It has two basic forms: Retinoids and Carotenoids.</p><h3>Retinoids</h3><p>Retinoids bring many specific immune, inflammatory, genetic and reproductive benefits, such as support during pregnancy and childbirth, support for childhood growth, nightvision, red blood cell prodoction and infectious disease resistence.</p>Retinoids are found only in animal based food, but it is possible to be converted from carotenoids, as well. Unoftunately, not every body has this ability.This ability is being compromised by several factors: genetics, digestive problems, bacterial imbalances in the gut, excessive alcohol use, excessive alcohol use, excessive exposure to toxins, imbalanced intake of vitamin A and vitamin D in supplement form and high intake of prescription medications.There are four basic retinoids: retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and retinyl esters.</p><h3>Carotenoids</h3><p>Carotenoids act as antioxidants and have anti-inflamatory functions. They offer protection for our body, but their main focus is on prevention of age-related macular degeneration (eye health).Carotenoids are devided in two groups: Carotenes (alpha-Carotene, beta-Carotene, gamma-Carotene, epsilon-Carotene, zeta-Carotene) and Xanthophylls (astaxanthin, beta-Cryptoxanthin, canthaxanthin, fucoxanthin, lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin).</p>",

        "deficiency": "<p>Vitamin A deficiency can occur as either a primary or a secondary deficiency. Primary vitamin A deficiency occurs among children and adults who do not consume an adequate intake of vitamin A. Secondary vitamin A deficiency is associated with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Due to the unique function of retinal as a visual chromophore, one of the earliest and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light (night blindness). Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as xerophthalmia. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, Meningococcal disease), hyperkeratosis (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium. With relations to dentistry, a deficiency in Vitamin A leads to enamel hypoplasia. Adequate supply, but not excess vitamin A, is especially important for pregnant and breastfeeding women for normal fetal development and in breastmilk. Deficiencies cannot be compensated by postnatal supplementation.</p>",
        "toxicity": "<p>Excessive vitamin A consumption can lead to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. In chronic cases, hair loss, dry skin, drying of the mucous membranes, fever, insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, bone fractures, anemia, and diarrhea can all be evident on top of the symptoms associated with less serious toxicity. Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.</p>",
        "relationship with other nutrients": "<h3>Protein</h3><p>The transport and utilization of vitamin A is dependent upon several vitamin A binding proteins. Because a sufficient dietary intake of protein is required for the manufacture of these binding proteins, inadequate protein intake may result in vitamin A deficiency.</p><h3>Fat</h3><p>Adequate intake of dietary fat is necessary for the absorption and utilization of vitamin A.</p><h3>Zinc</h3><p>Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because it is essential for the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency.</p><h3>Vitamin D</h3><p>Recent studies suggest that effects of vitamin D deficiency are worsened by high supplemental intake of vitamin A (in retinoid form).</p><h3>Vitamin K</h3><p>Excess retinoid-form vitamin A may interfere with the metabolism of vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for blood clotting</p><h3>Iron</h3><p>Vitamin A deficiency often coexists with iron deficiency and may exacerbate iron deficiency anemia by altering iron metabolism. Vitamin A supplementation has beneficial effects on iron deficiency anemia and improves iron nutritional status among children and pregnant women. The combination of supplemental vitamin A and iron seems to reduce anemia more effectively than either supplemental iron or vitamin A alone.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Vitamin C is a potent reducing agent, meaning that it readily donates electrons to recipient molecules. Because of this oxidation-reduction (redox) potential, vitamin C has two important functions: antioxidant and enzyme cofactor. Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble, non-enzymatic antioxidant in plasma and tissues. Even in small amounts vitamin C can protect indispensable molecules in the body, such as proteins, lipids (fats), carbohydrates, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), from damage by free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated during normal metabolism, by active immune cells, and through exposure to toxins and pollutants (for example, certain chemotherapy drugs and cigarette smoke). Vitamin C also participates in redox recycling of other important antioxidants (for example, it regenerates vitamin E from its oxidized ). Vitamin Câ€™s role as a cofactor is also related to its redox potential. By maintaining enzyme-bound metals in their reduced forms, vitamin C assists mixed-function oxidases in the synthesis of several critical biomolecules. Research also suggests that vitamin C is involved in the metabolism of cholesterol to bile acids, which may have implications for blood cholesterol levels and the incidence of gallstones.</p>",

The National Osteoporosis Foundation says, 'Calcium plays an important role in building stronger, denser bones early in life and keeping bones strong and healthy later in life'. Approximately 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. The rest of the calcium in the body has other important uses, such as some exocytosis, especially neurotransmitter release, and muscle contraction. Intracellular calcium overload may lead some kind of cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis, and thus producing several diseases. In the electrical conduction system of the heart, calcium replaces sodium as the mineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. In cardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but during potassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging the action potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium.</p>",

It can occur from taking medications, such as diuretics; medical treatments; or disease processes, such as renal failure or hypoparathyroidism.</p><p>An insufficient amount of calcium in your diet will generally not cause hypocalcemia.

The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, versus about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.</p>",

Some plant foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis.

This synthetic B12 is used to fortify foods and sold as a dietary supplement.</p><p>A common synthetic form of the vitamin is cyanocobalamin, produced by chemically modifying bacterial hydroxocobalamin. Because of superior stability and low cost this form is used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements as well as for fortification of foods.

However, folic acid is a synthetic oxidized form, not significantly found in fresh natural foods. To be used it must be converted to tetrahydrofolate (tetrahydrofolic acid) by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Increasing evidence suggests that this process may be slow in humans. Vitamin B9 is essential for numerous bodily functions. Humans cannot synthesize folates de novo; therefore, folic acid has to be supplied through the diet to meet their daily requirements. The human body needs folate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in certain biological reactions. It is especially important in aiding rapid cell division and growth, such as in infancy and pregnancy.

Total deficiency of thyroid hormones can reduce basal metabolic rate up to 50%. Excessive production of thyroid hormones can increase the basal metabolic rate by 100%. T4 acts largely as a precursor to T3, which is (with minor exceptions) the biologically active hormone. In amphibian metamorphosisiodine and thyroid hormones exert a well-studied experimental collections of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles.</p><p>Iodine accounts for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of the T3.

In the cells of these tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Its role in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but its role in the other tissues is partially unknown.</p>",

Other possible health effects being investigated as being related to iodine deficiency include:</p><h3>Breast cancer</h3><p>The breast strongly and actively concentrates iodine into breast-milk for the benefit of the developing infant, and may develop a goiter-like hyperplasia, sometimes manifesting as fibrocystic breast disease, when iodine levels are low.</p><h3>Stomach cancer</h3><p>Some researchers have found an epidemiologic correlation between iodine deficiency, iodine-deficient goitre and gastric cancer. A decrease of the incidence of death rate from stomach cancer after implementation of the effective iodine-prophylaxis has been reported, as well.</p><h3>Autism</h3><p>Although there is not a definitive answer for the cause of autism in children, research has shown that mothers with low levels of iodine are more likely to have an autistic child.</p>",
        "toxicity": "<p>Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally. Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic in the presence of selenium deficiency.

Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution are capable of causing tissue damage if their use for cleaning and antisepsis is prolonged; similarly, cases have been reported where liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns.</p><p>People can be exposed to iodine in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. Some people develop a hypersensitivity to iodine-containing products and foods. Applications of tincture of iodine or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe. Parenteral use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis. Such reactions have led to the misconception (widely held, even among physicians) that some people are allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed. In fact, there has never been a confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible. Patients with various food allergies (shellfish, egg, milk, etc.) as well as asthma are more likely to suffer reactions to iodine-containing contrast media; so as with all medications, the potential severity of reactions to medical iodine-containing products should prompt questions about a patient's allergy history before they are administered.</p>",

Iron deficiency can cause fatigue that impairs the ability to do physical work in adults. Iron deficiency may also affect memory or other mental function in teens. Signs of iron deficiency anemia include:</p><ul><li>Decreased immune function, which increases susceptibility to infection</li><li>Decreased work and school performance</li><li>Decreased work and school performance</li><li>Feeling tired and weak</li><li>Glossitis (an inflamed tongue)</li><li>Slow cognitive and social development during childhood</li></ul>",

Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, which can cause significant adverse effects, including coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure,coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six.</p>",

Other causes are increased renal or gastrointestinal loss, an increased intracellular shift, and proton-pump inhibitor antacid therapy. Most are asymptomatic, but symptoms referable to neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and metabolic dysfunction may occur. Alcoholism is often associated with magnesium deficiency. Chronically low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, fasciculation, and hypertension.</p>",

Overdose with magnesium tablets is possible in the presence of impaired renal function. There is a single case report of hypermagnesemia in a woman with normal renal function using high doses of magnesium salts for catharsis. The most common symptoms of overdose are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; other symptoms include hypotension, confusion, slowed heart andrespiratory rate, deficiencies of other minerals, coma, cardiac arrhythmia, and death from cardiac arrest.</p>",

The ATP molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion.</p><h3>Phosphorus</h3><p>Magnesium and phosphorus have a complex relationship with respect to absorption in the intestine. How much of each of these nutrients goes into the blood stream versus being lost in the stool is variable by relative amount, hormonal balance, and even time of day. In general, more magnesium tends to reduce phosphorus absorption.</p><h3>Calcium</h3><p>Studies suggest that absorption of magnesium from our intestine depends not only on the amount of magnesium that is present but also on the amount of calcium that is present, because the cells lining our intestine have a single spot (called the CaSR receptor) for absorbing these minerals. In practical terms, these circumstances suggest that our diet needs to be balanced in terms of magnesium, calcium, and the ratio of these two minerals.</p>",

Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and parkinsonian- like symptoms. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors are very broad, and include oxidoreductases, transferases,hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may bearginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic mitochondria, and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide (O-2), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen.</p>",

In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA.

At least 50 enzymes that contain molybdenum are now known in bacteria and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. These nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a different form from the other molybdenum-containing enzymes, which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum incorporated into a molybdenum cofactor. Owing to the diverse functions of the various molybdenum cofactor enzymes, molybdenum is a required element for life in all higher eukaryote organisms, though it is not required by all bacteria. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water. Once oxygen made by early life appeared in seawater, it helped dissolve molybdenum into soluble molybdate from minerals on the sea bottom, making it available for the first time to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and allowing them to provide more fixed usable nitrogen compounds for higher forms of life. In 2013, it was suggested possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago. Though molybdenum forms compounds with various organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout the human body as molybdate.</p>",

Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include numbness, paresthesia, and muscle cramps. Deficiency in pantothenic acid can also cause hypoglycemia, or an increased sensitivity to insulin. Insulin receptors are acylated with palmitic acid when they do not want to bind with insulin. Therefore, more insulin will bind to receptors when acylation decreases, causing hypoglycemia. Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. In a few rare circumstances, more serious (but reversible) conditions have been seen, such as adrenal insufficiency and hepatic encephalopathy.</p>",

The term electrolyte refers to a substance that dissociates into ions (charged particles) in solution, making it capable of conducting electricity. Normal body function depends on tight regulation of potassium concentrations both inside and outside of cells. Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells. Potassium ion shifts across nerve cell membranes are necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium depletion or excess can result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells, and an increase in potassium excretion by the kidney.</p>",

In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants. The glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze certain reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the thyroid gland and in every cell that uses thyroid hormone, by participating as a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites. Selenium may inhibit Hashimoto's disease, in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked as alien. Increased dietary selenium intakes reduce the effects of mercury toxicity that inhibits selenoenzyme secretion that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues.</p>",

In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can 'modulate brain excitability'. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However, it has been called 'the brain's dark horse' because it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system. Zinc is perceived by the public today as being of 'exceptional biologic and public health importance', especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development.</p>",

        "deficiency": "<p>Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children it causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, but can be associated with malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses. Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with renal insufficiency. Signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency include:</p><ul><li>Alopecia</li><li>Altered cognition</li><li>Defects in carbohydrate utilization</li><li>Depressed growth</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Eye and skin lesions</li><li>Impaired appetite</li><li>Impaired host defense properties</li><li>Impotence and delayed sexual maturation</li><li>Low immunity</li><li>Reproductive teratogenesis</li></ul>",
